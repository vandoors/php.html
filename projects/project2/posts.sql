Here are 10 tips to get you started:\r\n\r\n1. **Plan your meals** in advance and make a grocery list to avoid impulse buys \r\n2. Buy *whole foods* like fruits, veggies, grains and legumes instead of pricey packaged items\r\n3. Purchase foods that are ***in season*** and locally grown for the best prices and flavor\r\n4. Opt for less expensive protein sources like ~~meat~~ eggs, canned fish, beans and tofu\r\n5. Buy grains, nuts and spices from the `bulk bin` section to get just the amount you need\r\n6. Stock up on *sale items*, especially pantry staples and freezer-friendly foods\r\n7. Prep meals like soups, grain bowls and burritos in **big batches** to stretch your food budget\r\n8. Reduce meat consumption and make plant-based meals the star of your plate\r\n9. Grow some of your own *herbs and vegetables* at home, even if you only have a small space\r\n10. Minimize food waste by properly storing produce and getting creative with leftovers\r\n\r\n> Eating well on a budget takes some effort, but it\'s worth it.

Here are a few of my favorite hikes in the region:\r\n\r\n1. **Mount Si** - Just 30 miles east of Seattle, the 8-mile round trip hike up Mount Si provides a great workout and rewards you with panoramic views from the summit of the Cascade mountains and *Mount Rainier*.\r\n\r\n2. **Ecola State Park** - This scenic park on the Oregon coast offers several hiking options, from easy strolls to more challenging treks. Don\'t miss the stunning views of the rugged coastline and `Haystack Rock`.\r\n\r\n3. **Mount Storm King** - Located in the Olympic National Park in Washington, the short but steep climb up Mount Storm King leads you to an ~~exposed~~ summit with *breathtaking* views over **Lake Crescent** and the surrounding mountains. \r\n\r\n> No matter your hiking ability, you\'ll find an abundance of incredible trails to explore in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. So lace up your boots and get out there!',	'2024-03-05');
